			<p>	Welcome to where I put all my code. There's not a lot of it, but I'm working hard to remedy that. 
				My focus is on Java, which I'm learning that through the wonderful <a href ="">CS106A online course</a> 
				from Stanford. 
			</p>
			
			<p> In my free time, I've been guilty of certain <a href = "#">culinary travesties</a>, 
				<a href = "http://www.soundcloud.com/tomprince/" target = "_blank">musical cacophonies</a>, and 
				<a href = "#">making gift bags out of newspaper</a>. My interests definitely grow out of two loves: Being
				creative, and laughing a heck of a lot. 
			</p>
			
			<p> I also love to run, but haven't been out in about a month after a slight knee injury.
				Since I'm planning on participating in the 2012 ING Marathon, my current goal is to drop 10 pounds so I 
				can get back to actual running. On the bright side, the injury has introduced me to the elliptical and
				push-ups. We're best friends now.
