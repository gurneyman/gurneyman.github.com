			<h2> The Gist </h2>
		
			<p> This is where I put all my code. I'm still very much a novice, so there's not a lot of it, but I am 
				working hard to remedy that. Right now my focus is on Java, and I'm learning that through the wonderful 
				<a href ="">CS106A online course</a> from Stanford. My next steps from there will include learning to 
				develop for Android. I also know a bit about HTML, JavaScript, and CSS, as well as Python and a
				tiny bit of	C++. 
			</p>
			
			<p> In my free time, I've been guilty of certain <a href = "#">culinary travesties</a>, 
				<a href = "http://www.soundcloud.com/tomprince/" target = "_blank">musical cacophonies</a>, and 
				<a href = "#">making gift bags out of newspaper</a>. I love being creative, and I love to laugh 
				even more, and my interests definitely grow out of these two loves. 
			</p>
			
			<p> I also love to run, but haven't done so in about a month after a slight knee injury.
				Since I'm planning on participating in the 2012 ING Marathon, my current goal is to drop 10 pounds so I 
				can get back to actual running. On the bright side, the injury has introduced me to the elliptical and
				push-ups. We're best friends now.
